From $8000 onwards is the addresses allocated to cartridge PRG-ROM.

Games with only one 16 KB bank of PRG-ROM will load it into both $8000 and $C000. This is to ensure that the vector table is located in the correct addresses.

Games with two 16 KB PRG-ROM banks will load one into $8000 and the other into $C000.

Games with more than two banks use memory mappers to determine which banks to load into memory.
The memory mapper monitors memory writes for a specific address (or range of addresses) and when that address is written to, it performs a bank switch.
The details vary between different memory mappers and more information can be found in Appendix D.
